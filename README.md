YAWT is Yet Another Weblog Tool, written in python. It's a blogging/CMS
engine in the style of blohg, jekyll and other DVCS based blogging tools.

The idea is that you store your blog entries in a DVCS and we use that
metadata to gelan information like the create time, post time, last
modification time, etc.

yawt sports a plugin architecture and comes with plugins to support features
such as tags, archives, full text search, and markdown support.
