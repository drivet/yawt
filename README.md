YAWT is Yet Another Weblog Tool, written in python. It's a blogging/CMS
engine inspired by blohg, jekyll and even some blosxom for good measure.

yawt sports a plugin architecture and comes with plugins for features such
as tags, archives, full text search, markdown, social network and version
control integration.
